  Currently, all the typical Gateway resources have been created within the
  Network component due to Azure specific requirements. The Gateway will
  be utilised in a greater capacity when it comes to implimenting
  privateEndpoint resources. Leaving large portions of the macro
  intact so as to outline the future structure.

    Currently there are no "destination" requirements for an Azure Gateway component
    (they are created as a part of the Subnet resource in the Network component).
    The below structure is left available to ensure simple implimentation of Private
    Links at a later time.
